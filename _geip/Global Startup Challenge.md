<h1><strong>GLOBAL STARTUP CHALLENGE</strong></h1>
<p>The Global Startup Challenge enables students to strengthen entrepreneurial
skills, develop global mindsets and be exposed to innovation in the greater
world.&nbsp;All students in the programme will have access to experienced
business coaches and industry mentors.</p>
<h2><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></h2>
<p>We offer our interns the opportunity to work in teams to develop their
own business idea with a global perspective. Through hands-on experience
and close mentorship from business coaches, teams will gain a deeper understanding
of business planning, prototype building and pitching.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students will participate in a 3.5 days Global Startup Hackathon with
overseas participants from other institutions.</p>
