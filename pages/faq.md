### **FAQ**

Do you have questions about the programme? Find out more through the answers below or send your question to **[askgia@np.edu.sg](mailto:Askgia@np.edu.sg).**

I want to go for GEI! How do I know if I qualify?

There are usually two rounds of application for March and September internship semesters. All eligible students from polytechnics and autonomous universities are welcome to apply for GEI. If you are not a student at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, please check with your institution or email us to inquire about eligibility.

Students who are self-starters, who are open to learning from startups, and have evidence of their interest in entrepreneurship are welcome to apply!

Can anyone apply for GEI?

The internship programme is open to all students who are Singaporeans and Singapore Permanent Residents. Please check with your institution or email us if you are interested. Can I choose the country/company I wish to intern in?

While we seek to ensure you are comfortable in the country you are placed in, GIA and our partner company will make the final decision. You will be assessed whether you are a fit for the company and what they require in an intern. Shortlisted applicants need to go through a first round of interview with GIA. This is followed by interviews with the overseas companies GIA has allocated you to, tentatively based on your skillsets and soft skills displayed at the first round of interview.

A tentative allocation does not equal a confirmed placement. Students will still have to secure interviews with the overseas company.

Do I need to take my academic school’s internship and take GEI if I am selected?

Our internship replaces your school’s internship module.

I know I may need to write reports as part of my internship. If I am confirmed, who do I submit my internship reports to?

  
You will submit your academic internship report to your school internship supervisor. If there are additional assessments required by GIA, you will be informed by your Country Manager.

Are students on the programme offered any subsidies or allowances?

The subsidy offered will depend on your institution. Depending on the city and company you intern at, the structures will differ. More details will be provided to you once you are confirmed for the programme.  
  
For students at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, you will be supported with a generous grant that covers your flight, visa and accommodation for your internship duration. Can I use the Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA) to fund my living expenses for GEI?

PSEA cannot be used to support your expenses.

How much will I get for my monthly allowance?

You will given a monthly allowance that is sufficient for the duration of your overseas internship. Every city has different living standards and each company pays interns different allowance rates. Your monthly allowance will be city-specific.

Do I need to fulfill any academic commitments to qualify for GEI?

To work overseas for GEI, you need to meet all academic requirements of your institution.
