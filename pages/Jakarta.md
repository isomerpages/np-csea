<h1><strong>Jakarta</strong></h1>
<p>Indonesia is Southeast Asia’s biggest economy and Jakarta is its heart.
The city has a population of more than 10 million people and is home to
the majority of the country’s startup community. The growth potential in
Indonesia is huge as it is now a mobile-first nation, with 75 percent of
online purchases made via mobile devices. 50 million new individuals are
gaining online access from 2015 to 2020.</p>
<h2><strong>STARTUP ECOSYSTEM</strong></h2>
<p>Jakarta is home to four of the biggest unicorns in ASEAN: Go-Jek, Tokopedia,
Traveloka and Bukalapak. After initially focusing on the local market,
the Indonesian unicorns have kickstarted regional expansion, to countries
such as Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore. Cashless payments and E-money
adoption has been growing, driven by the rise of ride-hailing services.</p>
