<p>I interned remotely with Wonder Workshop, a robotics and education startup
based in Silicon Valley. As a Marketing Intern, my role involved creating
and designing digital content for their social media platforms as well
as posters/worksheets for classrooms that uses our robots. I also dabbled
with the company’s data analytics, making charts and graphs for meetings.
I’d say my experience interning remotely was very pleasant because the
people I worked with were very nice and understanding especially regarding
the time difference! Not only did I get to save money on transport and
meals, I also got to work more comfortably which made me enjoy working
a lot more.</p>
