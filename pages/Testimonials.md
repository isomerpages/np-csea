<p>I interned remotely with Wonder Workshop, a robotics and education startup
based in Silicon Valley. As a Marketing Intern, my role involved creating
and designing digital content for their social media platforms as well
as posters/worksheets for classrooms that uses our robots. I also dabbled
with the company’s data analytics, making charts and graphs for meetings.
I’d say my experience interning remotely was very pleasant because the
people I worked with were very nice and understanding especially regarding
the time difference! Not only did I get to save money on transport and
meals, I also got to work more comfortably which made me enjoy working
a lot more.</p>

<p>I was a Social Media And Content Intern at Maria 01 which is a statup
campus in Helsinki, Finland. I mainly managed all their social medias account
and came up with new content that was featured online. I worked on newsletters
alongside my supervisor and all in all, I truly enjoyed this internship!
I am grateful for them as even though I am the only one working remotely,
the team is still super inclusive.</p>

<p>GEIP was a great and valuable experience for me, alongside the exciting
internship with The FinLab, I got the opportunity to learn from experts
with the workshops conducted by the trainers at Reactor and Highspark to
develop and build my startup idea with the guidance from the GIA team!</p>
<p></p>
<p>My GEIP experience was actually what helped me land my current role at
a startup called Aimazing, after I shared with the team what I accomplished
with GEIP and The FinLab!</p>

<p>I was on GEIP from March to August 2020. I interned with a startup called
X0PA Ai, which developed a platform to scale the recruitment process for
companies. During my internship, I had the chance to work with colleagues
from other X0PA offices in London and India.
<br>Through the GEIP Startup Challenge I had a chance to further develop my
business idea for TableTalk, a card game I developed with my team to help
people facilitate conversations about the important questions in life.
We pitched and secured a grant from The Sandbox. We went on Kickstarter
to seek additional funding from backers. We received over $11,000 from
the Kickstarter campaign, giving us the resources to move into card production!</p>

<p>This internship makes me step out of my comfort zone because I am in a
new place and I have to adapt to his new environment around me. In most
startups, we don’t just usually stick to what you job description says,
you start doing things outside of what your job description actually encompasses.</p>

<p>Living and working in Finland exposed me to a totally different culture,
communication and mindset. Being adaptable and stepping out of my comfort
zone were essential. Takeaway: The opportunity to hone my leadership abilities
in taking charge of projects. I am now more responsible, mature and independent.</p>

<p>The most significant thing which I learned during the internship was the
importance of relational connections and networking. Talent can only bring
one so far, having the right people to bring the right opportunities at

<p>The internship provided me a with a real life scenario, where I could
put all my skills into good use. I also believe that interning at a startup
is something that we can only do at our age now. Start-ups demands a lot
of energy, time and effort. There is little to no hierarchy between the
boss and the co-workers. For example, my colleague would just tell the
boss directly, that her idea would not be successful. This is something
that is rarely seen in Singapore.</p>

<p>Through the GEIP, my biggest takeaway would be learning to adapt and embrace
the cultural and socio-economic differences that Bangkok presents. This
programme has been integral in transforming me into becoming a more articulate,
independent &amp; prudent individual, cultivating in me a greater sense
of responsibility and integrity.</p>

<p>This internship opportunity has been extremely fruitful and valuable.
It has made me step out of my comfort zone and experience a different culture.
I am really thankful to my colleagues and superiors for their warm hospitality.
Although there were difficulties such as language barrier, they constantly
guided and motivated me to strive harder. I feel that you should not underestimate
yourself but always try to challenge your own potential. Indonesia is actually
a huge and beautiful country so use the weekends wisely and explore different
parts of it!</p>

<p>Interning in Grab Indonesia has been such an eventful experience. It has
allowed me to gain so much knowledge with regards to analytics and operations,
and given me the opportunity to work in over 10 cities in Indonesia. I
was even allowed to lead projects, manage different cities, as well as
propose and implement new strategies to smoothen operations.</p>
