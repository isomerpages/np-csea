<h1><strong>Shenzhen</strong></h1>
<p>Shenzhen’s population has exploded from 1 million people, 30 years ago
to 12 million people today. It is a special economic zone backed by a fast
growth mentality, easy access to manufacturing hubs and funding from government
agencies. More than 90% of the population are not originally from the area.
Many professionals in the Shenzhen startup scene bring with them years
of experience gathered from working with tech giants in other parts of
China.</p>
