<summary>Can I choose the country/company I wish to intern in?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>While we seek to ensure you are comfortable in the country you are placed
in, GIA and our partner company will make the final decision. You will
be assessed whether you are a fit for the company and what they require
in an intern. Shortlisted applicants need to go through a first round of
interview with GIA. This is followed by interviews with the overseas companies
GIA has allocated you to, tentatively based on your skillsets and soft
skills displayed at the first round of interview.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A tentative allocation does not equal a confirmed placement. Students
will still have to secure interviews with the overseas company.</p>
