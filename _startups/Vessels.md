<p>Heart-to-Heart moments are hard to come by these days. With increasing
digitalization, we have somehow become more emotionally disconnected than
ever before. Loneliness looms over youths as they struggle to connect and
build real bonds with the people around them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vessels is an online brand that believes in starting intentional conversations.
TableTalk by Vessels is an intentional card game that creates meaningful
conversations. Through our thought-provoking and self-reflective content,
we have been able to gamify the conversations. Questions like “Do you feel
loved right now?” or “What are you holding onto that is holding you back?”
really gets you thinking. Action cards keep things silly and fun because
fun is part of the relationship-building process too! We have built a community
on Instagram where we post relatable and convicting content as well. Vessels
envisions a day when meaningful conversations become a “TableTalk” norm.</p>
