<p>Joshua graduated from Ngee Ann Polytechnic in 2017 from the School of
Films Media Studies&nbsp; FMS. He was part of the pioneer batch of GEIP
that went to Silicon Valley in 2016. Inspired by this internship experience,
he decided to take the plunge and start his own media production house
that pursues life beyond mediocrity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the heart of Imaginary Films, authentic relationships, stories and
characters are prioritised. Relationships matter because they are built
upon trust, and people work with people they trust. Stories matter because
authentic stories inspire action. Character matters because above performance,
it is character and attitude that qualifies a person.</p>
<p>Upon these values, Imaginary Films help brands, organizations and individuals
tell their stories through film, with impact in mind. Beyond numbers, beyond
figures, beyond mediocrity.&nbsp;</p>
