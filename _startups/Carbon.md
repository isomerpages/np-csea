<p>At Carbon, our mission is to create comfortable, protective and reusable
face masks. Our mask comes with advanced filtration technology, blocking
95% of airborne contaminants without trapping moisture. The three-ply ensures
that your face stays protected from harmful aerosol transmissions and respiratory
droplets. Designed for all-day wear and protection, we feature two series
—— Carbon Air and Carbon Classic, all of which is lightweight, ultra-soft
and breathable. The ultimate urban mask.</p>
